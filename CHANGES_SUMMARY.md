## ✅ Code Changes (Already Done - Ready to Deploy)

I've already fixed the code to handle missing agent pictures:

### What Changed in `nodes.py`:

**Before:** If no agent picture uploaded → Would cause error or use hardcoded URL

**After:** If no agent picture uploaded → Creatomate template uses its default image

**How it works:**
1. User uploads agent picture → Uses uploaded picture ✅
2. User doesn't upload agent picture → Template's default picture is used ✅
3. Upload fails → Template's default picture is used ✅

## 📍 What Each Change Does

| Change | Effect | User Sees |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Agent name → Your name | Form pre-filled with your name | Can still edit if needed |
| Email → Your email | Form pre-filled with your email | Can still edit if needed |
| Phone → Your phone | Form pre-filled with your phone | Can still edit if needed |
| No agent picture handling | Template uses default | No error, video still generates |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **These are DEFAULT values** - Users can still change them
2. **Agent picture is now OPTIONAL** - If not uploaded, template's default is used
3. **All changes are backwards compatible** - Existing workflows still work
4. **Your API keys remain safe** - Never in the code or GitHub
